		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even in 2021, email marketing is considered one of the most cost-efficient digital marketing tools. Its high ROI (Return on Investment) shows that even with a relatively small investment it can significantly boost a company&rsquo;s sales.</p><p>Modern email marketing isn&rsquo;t always given the credit it deserves &ndash; some may still view it as &ldquo;old school&rdquo;, with newer digital marketing methods such as social media marketing often being in the spotlight of the conversation. However, when used to its fullest potential, email marketing can be an extremely effective method for nurturing your leads and engaging long-time customers.</p><p>So, don&rsquo;t just aimlessly spam your potential customers with individual ads or campaigns &ndash; utilize these 8 tips in your email marketing strategy:</p><ol><li><a href="#1">Build your mailing list yourself</a></li><li><a href="#2">Fight for attention with a compelling subject line</a></li><li><a href="#3">Create real value</a></li><li><a href="#4">Don&rsquo;t bore the reader</a></li><li><a href="#5">Engage by activating</a></li><li><a href="#6">Optimize, personalize, automate</a></li><li><a href="#7">Fine-tune the visual design to match your brand</a></li><li><a href="#8">Let the subscriber decide for themself</a></li></ol><h2><a name="1"></a>1. Build your mailing list yourself</h2><p><em>I don&rsquo;t remember signing up for this newsletter? How did this company even get my email address? 👀</em></p><p>This is often the reaction of a person who receives a random marketing email from a company they&rsquo;ve never heard of. They will likely either ignore the email, immediately unsubscribe from the mailing list, or move the message straight to junk mail. This can also harm your deliverability.</p><p><strong>Never buy a mailing list &ndash; always build it yourself.</strong></p><p>By buying a mailing list, you&rsquo;re essentially spending money on a bunch of non-functioning, or at least non-targeted, email addresses. The worst-case scenario is that the list you purchase isn&rsquo;t even collected legally, and you&rsquo;ll end up damaging your organization&rsquo;s reputation.</p><p>Nurturing your leads and engaging your customers is much more efficient when they have subscribed to your newsletter out of their own will. This way they&rsquo;ll receive exactly what they signed up for instead of being spammed with emails they don&rsquo;t care about.</p><h3>How can I gain subscribers?</h3><p>There are various ways to gain subscribers to your newsletter. One of the most common methods is using an opt-in form. Make it visible on your website, and show it to your online store customers when they make a purchase, or to online visitors who sign up to your event or join a membership program, to name a few.</p><p>You can also lure people to your mailing list with lead magnets by offering them valuable content such as downloadable guides or discount codes, or by running a giveaway, for instance.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Find out more about growing your own database: <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/the-end-of-third-party-cookies-how-to-prepare-with-digital-marketing-tools-infographic" target="_blank">The End of Third-party Cookies &ndash; How to Prepare with Digital Marketing Tools?&nbsp;</a></div><p>Using a double opt-in function ensures that your subscribers&rsquo; email addresses are real, as it requires them to confirm the email through a link sent to them personally. At the end of each newsletter, make sure to let the recipient know why they received the email &ndash; or in other words, how your organization got their email address.</p><p><img alt="" height="757" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-engage-customers-with-email-marketing-8-tips/example-resq.png" width="701" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.resq-club.com/" target="_blank">ResQ </a>offers its customers personal referral codes, which they can use to gain discount codes for both their friends and themselves. The new users are added to their mailing list.</em></p><h2><a name="2"></a>2. Fight for attention with a compelling subject line</h2><p>Many people read their emails on mobile devices. According to <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics/" target="_blank">eMailmonday,</a> depending on factors such as your target audience, the amount of mobile email users can be as high as 78%. It&rsquo;s therefore very likely that you&rsquo;re fighting for the recipient&rsquo;s attention with a flood of notifications.</p><p>Which one would you click on first: new Instagram likes, a Facebook post, a message from a friend, a tweet posted by your favorite public figure, or an email from a company?</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s a jungle out there: the competition of a potential customer&rsquo;s attention is tough.</strong></p><p>Focus on creating attention-grabbing subject lines: this is a crucial part of the engagement process. The headline alone must communicate the value brought by the newsletter, and compel the recipient to open and read it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing/overview.html" target="_blank">A/B testing</a> allows you to assess what kind of subject lines work for your target audience. The function allows you to send two different versions of the newsletter to a small percentage of your mailing list, and to finally choose the headline that performed better for the rest of the recipients.</p><p>Pay attention to the length of the subject line as well. On many devices, only the first few words fit the screen. Because of this, prefer shorter subject lines of about five to seven words.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Delve deeper into the topic: <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/how-do-i-write-a-good-subject-line.html" target="_blank">How Do I Write a Good Subject Line?</a></div><p class="small"><img alt="" height="1205" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-engage-customers-with-email-marketing-8-tips/example-gymshark.png" width="700" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.gymshark.com/" target="_blank">Gymshark</a>&rsquo;s subject line </em>So&hellip; what will we talk about? <em>draws the reader&rsquo;s attention. By asking their subscribers what topics they&rsquo;re interested in, the company is able to provide them with more valuable content.</em></p><h2><a name="3"></a>3. Create real value</h2><p>Make sure that each newsletter brings value to the subscribers. The email can bring concrete benefits to the receiver, such as:</p><ul><li>Tips or a guide</li><li>A personal offer or a discount code</li><li>Personalized content, such as an article picked specifically for the individual based on their previously read content</li><li>A reminder</li><li>An invite to an event</li></ul><p><img alt="" class="shadow-image" height="850" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-engage-customers-with-email-marketing-8-tips/example-linkedin.png" width="574" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/liana-technologies" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> offers free personalized courses for its users in their newsletters. The reader has to act fast if they want to access the courses, as they&rsquo;re only available for a limited time.</em></p><p>Value can also be created by evoking emotions or by creating a positive image of the organization. This will strengthen the organization&rsquo;s brand image and help with the long-term engagement process of your customers. Examples of this would be thank you and welcome letters, or showing the customer you value their opinion by asking for their feedback.</p><h2><a name="4"></a>4. Don&rsquo;t bore the reader</h2><p>Especially when it comes to social media, there&rsquo;s a clear trend regarding the length of content: both texts and videos are getting shorter.&nbsp;</p><p>It is true that <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/blog-seo-17-tips-to-make-your-blog-rank-higher-on-google-with-real-examples.html" target="_blank">longer content of about 1 200 words tends to perform better when it comes to online search results</a>. However, when we&rsquo;re aimlessly browsing our phones, we tend to prefer short Instagram captions or 280 character tweets over longer articles.</p><p>The same applies to the video content: Instagram Stories or Reels that only last for a couple of seconds are increasing in popularity, as they&rsquo;re easier to watch than 10 minutes long videos.</p><p>Keep this in mind when you&rsquo;re designing your newsletters: <strong>don&rsquo;t bore your subscribers or scare them away by including too much text.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Unless we&rsquo;re specifically looking for certain information, we often tend to opt for easy-to-consume content that doesn&rsquo;t challenge our attention span for too long. If the newsletter seems too time-consuming and hard to read during a coffee break, for instance, many receivers are likely going to skip reading it.</p><p>Your newsletter should therefore be brief enough to maintain the receiver&rsquo;s interest and attention. Lure the reader in with light, easy-to-approach content, and direct them to your longer main content such as articles, landing pages, or online stores, with links. Don&rsquo;t include too much information in the newsletter itself.</p><h2><a name="5"></a>5. Engage by activating</h2><p>Once you have managed to get the reader to open your email and to quickly scan through the upper part of the letter, it&rsquo;s time to encourage them to take action.</p><p>This is perhaps one of the most important steps in the engagement process, as directing the reader to an online store, a landing page or to some action will help nurture your leads into customers.</p><p>The easiest way to activate your newsletter readers is by using a <strong>Call-to-Action (CTA) button</strong>. It can be, for instance:</p><ul><li>Browse New Products</li><li>Continue Reading</li><li>Download the Guide</li><li>Rate Us (perhaps a star rating that the reader can easily click on?)</li></ul><p>The CTA must be visually clear and easy to understand. It must be designed in a way that makes it stand out from the rest of the content. It must also be placed high enough on the letter so that the readers who only quickly scan through the message will see it before exiting.</p><h2><a name="6"></a>6. Optimize, personalize, automate</h2><p>The great thing about digital marketing is that clicking the links on newsletters and websites leaves a digital trail that can be very beneficial to a company. Essentially everything can be measured one way or another, and marketers can and should utilize the collected data in their email marketing.</p><p>Focusing on the marketing efforts that bring results and tweaking the ones that don&rsquo;t perform as well will help you <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/know-the-value-of-your-marketing-actions-the-basics-of-roi.html" target="_blank">improve the ROI of your marketing</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Collecting data allows you to <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/8-tips-to-personalize-your-emails.html" target="_blank">personalize your emails</a>. Newsletter&nbsp;subscribers can, for instance, be recommended informative articles on a topic they&rsquo;re interested in, or help them find a product with the specific features they&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p>Additionally, if the customer has allowed their name to be saved during a purchase or in an opt-in form, including their name in the newsletter may be a nice additional touch.</p><p>By segmenting their mailing list, a company can target specific messages to recipients of certain criteria. The segments can be categorized based on their previous actions such as purchases, or demographic factors such as age, for example. This way newsletters can be tailored for a specific target audience.</p><p>The collected data can also be used in automation, which tends to go hand in hand with email marketing. Specific actions can be set to trigger an automated email, such as a shopping cart reminder in online stores or a thank you letter after a purchase or an event. By utilizing data, the messages can be sent at the right time either as individual messages or drip campaigns to effectively engage the customer.&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="7"></a>7. Fine-tune the visual design to match your brand&nbsp;</h2><p>Brand continuity is key: how do you want to communicate your brand in your newsletters?</p><p><strong>Follow your brand guidelines in the designs of your emails and landing pages.</strong> Small details such as linguistic or visual choices may not feel too important, but they can significantly impact your Click-through rates and how your customers view your brand.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasing your brand recognition can directly impact customer loyalty and help to engage single-time purchasers into loyal regular customers.</p><p>An aesthetically pleasing design will help to maintain the reader&rsquo;s interest. Use visual elements such as images, videos, infographics, and various layout options in your newsletters.&nbsp;</p><p>In this video, our Designer Edi and Communications Manager Fanni discuss newsletter design trends for 2021 &ndash; in case you need inspiration.</p><div class="embeddedContent oembed-provider-youtube" data-align="none" data-oembed="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEjMCDQOfeY" data-oembed_provider="youtube" data-resizetype="noresize"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" frameborder="0" height="349" scrolling="no" src="https://www.lianatech.com//www.youtube.com/embed/dEjMCDQOfeY?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=fM6k5" width="425"></iframe></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By testing different layout and style options you can find out, what kind of elements work the best for your audience. We use LianaMailer&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing/overview.html" target="_blank">heatmap feature</a> to see which elements on our newsletters are clicked the most.</p><h2><a name="8"></a>8. Let the subscriber decide for themself</h2><p>After completing all of the previous steps, you have to find an optimal frequency for sending your newsletters. A newsletter sent too often may be considered spam &ndash; but at the same time, you also want to make sure you&rsquo;re sending enough emails to help you with the engaging process.</p><p>Consider tailoring the number of letters for your customers&rsquo; individual needs by letting them choose for themselves in the opt-in form. Ask them, whether they want to receive an email from you daily, weekly, or monthly, for instance, and what kind of content they would like to see from you.</p><p>For instance, a person reading an online newspaper may want to receive a compilation of news related to a specific field, such as business and economics, every morning. Another reader of the same magazine will want a recap of the most important headlines across all fields once a week.</p><p>The same can apply to an online store as well: a person interested in a specific field, such as technology or fashion, may want to receive information on the latest products once a week, whereas an occasional shopper may want a similar newsletter only once a month.</p><p>When the content specifically meets the customer&rsquo;s needs, activating them becomes much easier. A reader of a magazine will click on the articles they&rsquo;re interested in, and an online shopper will benefit from the offers that are sent to them at a convenient time.</p><p><img alt="" height="806" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how-to-engage-customers-with-email-marketing-8-tips/example-nytimes.png" width="994" /></p><p><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> has created tens of different newsletters for their readers. The subscriber can choose both the frequency and the topic of the content they want to receive.</em></p><h3>If they want to leave, let them go</h3><p>Unsubscribing from a mailing list should also be easy for the reader with a simple link in the newsletter. Don&rsquo;t try to trick your subscribers into staying with you by making the process complicated. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><ol><li>A mailing list full of inactive contacts will be of no use to you.</li><li>User-friendliness is a value in itself &ndash; if unsubscribing is&nbsp;difficult, it will only make your company and&nbsp;website look bad.</li><li>If unsubscribing isn&rsquo;t easy enough, many people may simply move the emails to their junk folder. This can impact the deliverability of your newsletters.</li></ol><h2>Want to learn more about digital marketing and communications?</h2><p><a name="blog-form-newsletter"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The End of Third-party Cookies – How to Prepare with Digital Marketing Tools? [infographic]</title>
		<link>https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/the-end-of-third-party-cookies-how-to-prepare-with-digital-marketing-tools-infographic.html</link>
		<description>Third-party cookies are soon facing their end. Google’s announcement to abandon third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022 was the last nail to the coffin. Let’s go through what is going to change from the marketer’s perspective, and most importantly: how you can prepare for the changes with digital marketing tools.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketers&#39; love for third-party cookies has continued since the late 1990s. Now the romance has faced trouble in paradise.&nbsp;</p><p>Operators like Mozilla and Google are planning to stop or have already stopped using third-party cookies, which will cause a dramatic change to the basis of online advertising.</p><p>It still remains unclear what the future of digital marketing looks like, but in this article, we&rsquo;ll try to paint a bit more clear image of the situation.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go through the following questions:</p><ul><li><a href="#1">What are cookies?</a></li><li><a href="#2">What changes are coming to third-party cookies?</a></li><li><a href="#3">What do the cookie changes mean from a marketer&rsquo;s perspective?</a></li><li><a href="#4">How can I prepare for the cookie changes with digital marketing tools?</a></li></ul><p>If you are a visual learner, check the preparation tips from the <a href="#5">infographic at the end of this article</a> 👀</p><h1><a name="1"></a>What are cookies?</h1><p>Cookies allow a user to be tracked when they visit different websites. They are a common way to recognize website users and create personalized browsing experiences.</p><p>Cookies are typically divided into two categories:</p><p><strong>First-party cookies</strong> are stored by the website you are currently visiting. These cookies are used to make your on-site experience better, for example by remembering selected site preferences and the content of your shopping cart. First-party cookies also allow website owners to collect analytics data.&nbsp;</p><p>The use of first-party cookies can be declined by the website visitor, but doing so might make the user experience poor.</p><p><strong>Third-party cookies</strong> are cookies set by a website other than the one you are currently visiting, via using targeting pixels or similar techniques. Third-party cookies are utilized to track consumer behavior online: for example, to track visitors between websites and to show more relevant ads to them. This makes third-party cookies powerful marketing tools.</p><p>Many browsers, like <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10218/full-third-party-cookie-blocking-and-more/" target="_blank">Safari</a>, are now blocking third-party cookies by default. In <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/disable-third-party-cookies" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, cross-site tracking cookies are blocked by default. The website visitor can also decline the use of third-party cookies by themselves. By doing so, the ads and content shown to the person might not be that relevant anymore.</p><p>A simple way to tell the difference between these cookie types: if the cookie is associated with the domain you are visiting, it&rsquo;s a 1st party cookie. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a 3rd party cookie.</p><h1><a name="2"></a>What changes are coming to third-party cookies?</h1><p>With the passage of <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/tags.html?tagged=GDPR" target="_blank">GDPR</a> and other similar regulations, the privacy rights of website users are protected carefully.</p><p>Websites now need to openly share information about what customer data is collected, stored and shared forward. This has put pressure on many operators in the tech industry and pushed decision-making towards the current situation.</p><p>Some browsers, like Safari and Mozilla Firefox, have already stopped supporting third-party cookies. A year ago, in January 2020, <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html" target="_blank">Google also announced</a> that it will phase out third-party cookies from Chrome within the next two years. Google&#39;s announcement, at the latest, is forcing marketers to think about their action plans since Google takes nearly 70% of the browser market.</p><p>The big players of the field are the ones who get the most out of the new situation. For example Google, Amazon and Facebook already have tons of user data in their hands, which puts them in a very different position compared to smaller companies.</p><p>Marketers have been expecting the cookie changes, but there are still many question marks in the air. Big changes can be awaited in 2021.</p><h1><a name="3"></a>What do the cookie changes mean from a marketer&rsquo;s perspective?</h1><p>It&rsquo;s important for every marketer to plan what to do after third-party cookies won&rsquo;t be dominant anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital advertising has relied heavily on targeting &ndash; and targeting in its current form will soon be history. Marketers need to adjust their practices to be able to continue collecting user data and targeting ads to relevant recipients on different platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>New methods are also needed for measuring the results of advertising because it&#39;s been expressly the third-party cookies that have shown the link between ad exposure and conversion.</p><p>The upcoming changes may sound ominous at first, but they also bring good things among them. The transparency of advertising is likely to increase and the privacy of consumers will improve. In the future, user data will be collected on the basis of consent, which will likely make customers feel more secure and satisfied.</p><p>The companies to whom the customer voluntarily discloses their information will gain the leads. It is more important than ever to be able to establish a confidential relationship with the customer. The customer will more likely hand over their personal data for your use if they trust you, understand why and how you use their data and also see that this way you are improving their customer experience.</p><p>The uncertainty with third-party cookies increases the importance of first-party cookies &ndash; meaning the data you have collected, you own and manage. The companies possessing a lot of customer data will become data-rich. In the next paragraph, we give you tips on how to become data-rich on your own.</p><h1><a name="4"></a>How can I prepare for the cookie changes with digital marketing tools?</h1><p>Don&rsquo;t panic &ndash; the use of third-party cookies will end, but platforms are creating new, alternative solutions for online advertising.</p><p>While waiting for new solutions, it&rsquo;s smart to focus on the actions you can already perform on your own:</p><ul><li>Start leveraging first-party data</li><li>Build your own audience and customer database</li><li>Keep your contact list clean</li><li>Plan strategies to make the most of your contact database</li></ul><h2>Start leveraging first-party data</h2><p>Acquire tools that help you leverage first-party data more effectively. Capturing leads with <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing/overview.html" target="_blank">email marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/marketing-automation/overview.html" target="_blank">marketing automation</a> is becoming more critical, as it gets harder to reach customers by targeted advertising.</p><p>Also, take a look at the first-party data you already possess and make sure that you share it across the organization. First-party data might be found from sources you hadn&#39;t even thought about. Check your CRM, billing systems, call center and other channels that might contain customer data, and build a better understanding of your contacts.</p><h2>Grow your own database</h2><p>The data you have collected yourself and have permission to use is extremely valuable because it won&#39;t be affected by the changes made by other companies.</p><p>Here are smart techniques you can use for growing the size of your own contact database &ndash; without using third-party cookies.</p><h3>Collect contacts through landing pages</h3><p>A landing page with a form is an effective way to collect a bunch of new contacts &ndash; just make sure that you give something valuable in exchange. Maybe you could arrange a raffle, or share a downloadable guide?</p><div class="embeddedContent oembed-provider-youtube" data-align="none" data-oembed="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SuHVzMSSEb0;t=1s" data-oembed_provider="youtube" data-resizetype="noresize"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" frameborder="0" height="349" scrolling="no" src="https://www.lianatech.com//www.youtube.com/embed/SuHVzMSSEb0?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=Hk6qb" width="425"></iframe></div><p class="small"><em>In this <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/how-to-create-a-highly-converting-landing-page-in-2020-video.html" target="_blank">video</a>, Elena and Emma from Liana&rsquo;s marketing team share their best tips for highly converting landing pages.</em></p><h3>Make the most of your events</h3><p>Events &ndash; no matter if they are live or online &ndash; always attract new faces to attend. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to get contact information from as many participants as possible.</p><p>Collect contact info already in the registration phase and add the event or webinar attendees to your mailing list. Just remember to follow GDPR requirements and ask for permission to use the contact.</p><h3>Easy email subscription from websites</h3><p>Make sure that your newsletter subscription form cannot be missed on your websites. Subscription option should stand out at a glance on every single page. Also add newsletter subscription boxes to landing pages, blog articles and other content. Like this (smart, huh?):</p><p><a name="blog-form-newsletter"></a></p><h3>Lure your eCommerce customers to subscribe</h3><p>A newsletter is an essential promotion channel for eCommerce. Add the possibility of a newsletter subscription to your order form. Offer small benefits, like a discount code or special offers for those who subscribe.</p><h3>Make your crew sell the newsletter</h3><p>Best way to get new subscribers is to let people know about your newsletter.

		<title>How to Create a Great Press Release?</title>
		<link>https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/how-to-create-a-great-press-release.html</link>
		<description>You can tell when you have a great press release in your hands. It’s ready to publish as it is, succinct, easy to understand and has an interesting topic with a clearly stated core point.  A great release also has a clear and consistent structure that follows a pattern proven to be successful.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Press releases are a great tool to let everyone know about an event involving your company. It can be a regular statement, the launch of a product, or a new organization telling the world that they are now open for business.</p><p>In any case, for your press release to bring real visibility, you need to invest in its redaction. Build your press release with an engaging title, a summary that says it all, a thorough body, an accurate boilerplate, but also images, quotes, and stats. Without forgetting contact information.</p><p>You have all of the necessary information to fill those parts, but you&rsquo;re not sure how to articulate them? You&rsquo;re at the right place: keep reading and learn how to create a great press release!</p><h1>What should your press release be about?</h1><p>Almost any type of organization can write a press release: it can be a small company, a big corporation, an NGO, a charity, or even a municipality. Then, depending on who is writing, the subject can be very different:</p><ul><li>The launch of a new product or service</li><li>Participation in a competition or contest &ndash; and ultimately the results</li><li>A new partnership</li><li>A customer success story</li><li>Hosting an event</li><li>A company&rsquo;s rebranding process</li><li>Announcing an acquisition, or a merger</li><li>How the company is managing a crisis</li><li>A topic to gain public attention</li></ul><p>We at Liana Technologies actively publish press releases via LianaPress and our own websites. The releases have covered multiple topics: for example when we advanced to the final of the EBA (European Business Awards) in 2019, when we entered the Brazilian market last year and when results of our surveys were published for example.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">To know more about which type of press release is the most efficient, you can check our article <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/journalists-tell-what-kind-of-press-release-goes-through-in-the-media.html" target="_blank">Journalists Tell: What Kind of Press Release Goes Through in the Media?</a></div><h1>How to start the writing process of the press release?</h1><p>When you have decided what your press release will be about, it is time to actually write it. To facilitate the writing process, the structure of your press release can be separated into three parts:</p><p><img height="960" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how_to_create_a_great_press_release_2021/press-release-triangle-eng.png" width="1100" alt="" /></p><h2>1. Grab the reader&#39;s attention</h2><h3>Headline</h3><p>The headline (or title) of your press release is the most important part of it. If it is not catchy enough, your release won&rsquo;t be read. So, without neglecting the rest of your piece, you have to pay extra attention to it.</p><p>A good title is engaging, not too long, but not too short either: you have to carefully choose your words to tickle people&rsquo;s curiosity and make them open your press release. Remember though that balance is the key, so it&rsquo;s best to avoid click-bait headlines or too mysterious titles.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some headlines that caught our attention:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;<em>Shave the Date: McDonald&#39;s&reg; Is Giving Away 10,000 Free McRib Sandwiches to Fans Who Shave Their Facial Hair</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/press-releases.mcrib-shave-the-date.html" target="_blank">McDonald&rsquo;s</a></li><li>&ldquo;<em>Novotel teams up with Disney and Pixar&rsquo;s all-new feature film &ldquo;SOUL&rdquo; for the second phase of their global collaboration with Disney and Pixar movies.</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://press.accor.com/novotel-teams-up-with-disney-and-pixar-all-new-feature-film-soul/?lang=en" target="_blank">Novotel</a></li><li>&ldquo;<em>BlaBlaCar &amp; Voi Technology join forces to offer BlaBla Ride scooters in France</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://blog.blablacar.com/newsroom/news-list/blablaride" target="_blank">BlaBlaCar</a></li></ul><h3>Lead</h3><p>The lead is a short paragraph including the most important elements of the press release. This is when you need the famous &ldquo;5 Ws&rdquo;: who, what, when, where, and why, to give all the relevant information in a few lines only.</p><p>You have to think that a journalist who doesn&rsquo;t have the time to read your press release will only rely on this summary, so you want to make it short but effective.</p><p>If we keep reading the aforementioned press releases, the different summaries are the following:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;<em>In honor of the nationwide return of the McRib on December 2, McDonald&rsquo;s is partnering with No-Shave November, giving people a new way to support cancer research</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/press-releases.mcrib-shave-the-date.html" target="_blank">McDonald&rsquo;s</a></li><li>&ldquo;<em>For the first time, BlaBlaCar extended its multimodal offer into micro-mobility by joining forces with Swedish e-scooter company Voi Technology. Thanks to this strategic partnership, BlaBla Ride scooters will help French cities and their citizens have access to safe and sustainable mobility at a time when it is more crucial than ever. Both companies remain separate legal entities.</em>&rdquo; - <a href="https://blog.blablacar.com/newsroom/news-list/blablaride" target="_blank">BlaBlaCar</a></li></ul><h2>2. Delve into the subject</h2><h3>Body</h3><p>The body of your press release is the longest part in terms of content. In it, the lead is developed more thoroughly, by providing further details. Remember to communicate the most important information first, and the least important in the end.&nbsp;</p><p>When you are writing your press release, use vocabulary that is easy to understand. Using too specific terms and creating complex sentences won&rsquo;t make the reading of your piece agreeable: again, keep it simple.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what BlaBlaCar&rsquo;s press release&rsquo;s body looks like:</p><p><img alt="" height="1127" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how_to_create_a_great_press_release_2021/body-pr-article.png" width="795" /></p><p>In the body of your press release, you can insert quotes or statistics, in order to make your piece more complete and reliable.</p><p>Also, the writing style of the press release doesn&rsquo;t need to be extremely formal. Instead, try to personalize the content a little bit, and a bold approach can help you to stand out from the crowd!</p><h2>3. Finishing touches</h2><h3>Boilerplate</h3><p>The boilerplate is one of the latter elements of your press release. This part is a short description of your company, your product, or the person that is the core subject of your release. Here you can also insert a link to your website or to a landing page regarding your product.</p><h3>Contact information</h3><p>It is vital to add the contact information of someone who can provide more details about the topic. It can be a phone number or email address, and if a journalist calls to have more information about the topic, you have to answer right away.</p><div class="Article__Quote ckeditor-template ckeditor-template-section"><div class="Article__QuoteBubble ckeditor-template-section">&quot;The contact person needs to be available for the whole press release publishing day &ndash; in the evening as well. It is beyond frustrating to try to get a hold of a contact person who doesn&rsquo;t answer. Many story details or even a whole press release haven&rsquo;t been published because of this on occasion. Because I also train PR people, I formulate it for them like this: the contact person eats, jogs, goes to the sauna, makes love, and sleeps with their phone in hand for the next 24 hours!&quot;</div><div class="Article__QuotePerson ckeditor-template-section"><div class="Article__QuoteName ckeditor-template-section">A respondent to our<a href="https://www.lianatech.com/guide-effective-pr-with-press-releases.html?utm_source=blog_article&amp;utm_medium=how_to_create_a_great_press_release" target="_blank"> international survey</a></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example from <a href="https://press.accor.com/novotel-teams-up-with-disney-and-pixar-all-new-feature-film-soul/?lang=en" target="_blank">Novotel</a>, showing that you can insert information concerning your own company in the boilerplate, but also concerning the third parties mentioned in your press release:<img alt="" height="1162" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how_to_create_a_great_press_release_2021/about-novotel.png" width="1093" /></p><p>Even if you are a worldwide known company, you should add a boilerplate to your press release, just like McDonald&rsquo;s does:&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" height="216" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/how_to_create_a_great_press_release_2021/about-mcdonalds.png" width="749" /></p><p>Before sending your press release, make sure that you have all of these elements &ndash; the ideal length being one page. Don&rsquo;t forget to add the logo of your company in the beginning, so that the reader knows which company is in question.&nbsp;</p><p>You also need to insert the date of the press release above the headline. If the press release is embargoed (meaning if it is to be published on a later date), this is where you would want to give this information.</p><p>Last tip: adding images and videos to illustrate what you are saying is a really good idea, as they increase the likelihood that the press release will be published. Add all the visuals and other extra materials to your press release as links: this ensures that the quality is good and that the receiver&#39;s inbox won&#39;t jam.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Are you looking for more tips to create a performing press release?

You can send it to journalists that will publish it on their media, but you can also publish it on newsrooms, pressrooms, on your own website, and on social media.</p><p>If you decide to share it with journalists and think that the right approach is to send it to everyone in your database to make sure that someone will publish it: we have a tip for you.&nbsp;</p><p>You need to target the journalists that will be interested in your topic, so make sure that they are experts in your field and that they will know what you&rsquo;re talking about. A journalist specialized in the food-processing industry would definitely be more interested in a piece about this field rather than about arts and crafts.</p><p>Even if your press release is not published this time doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should stop writing and sending them. It might be that the journalists are not familiar with you yet, but if you keep informing them, you might get published one day.</p><p>Are you looking for a tool to create and publish effective press releases?

Brand accountability</h1><p>Brands are expected to take a stand and show transparency. For example here at Liana, we showcase our values and <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/about-us/csr.html" target="_blank">CSR actions</a> publicly on our website.</p><div class="Article__Quote ckeditor-template ckeditor-template-section"><div class="Article__QuoteBubble ckeditor-template-section">Corporate social responsibility is a crucial aspect of doing business nowadays. The amount of consumers that have woken up to the urgent need of a sustainable business model is growing rapidly. Transparency is expected and demanded of businesses in all industries.

Brands that were seen purposeful <a href="https://www.falcon.io/insights-hub/topics/social-media-strategy/brand-activism/" target="_blank">grew 2x faster</a> compared to other brands. Companies need to realize that they can&rsquo;t escape transparency and by not being truthful they have to pay the costs.&nbsp;</p><p class="small"><img alt="" height="466" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/10-marketing-trends-2021/cache/brand-accountability-nike-example-700x466.jpg" width="700" /><br /><em>In their new video ad <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/nike-celebrates-the-power-of-dance-and-enduring-strength-of-black-women/" target="_blank">Nike</a> wants to showcase and celebrate female empowerment.</em></p><h1><a name="2"></a>2. Multichannel influencer marketing</h1><p>Influencer marketing isn&rsquo;t slowing down and you don&rsquo;t have to spend a fortune on it. Micro and nano influencers (&lt;25k followers) have <a href="https://later.com/blog/influencer-marketing-trends/" target="_blank">the highest engagement rates</a> and offer great results for businesses.</p><p>Influencer marketing shouldn&rsquo;t be only narrowed to influencer&rsquo;s or key opinion leader&rsquo;s social media channels. Instead, brands are now utilizing influencers in their own multichannel marketing campaigns.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.linqia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2021-Influencer-Marketing-Cheat-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Linqia</a> suggests using influencer-generated content on a company&rsquo;s website, online store and email marketing.</p><p class="alert border border-200 bg-100"><strong>Do you want to learn more about influencer marketing?</strong> Check our article&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/key-opinion-leaders-who-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=marketing_trends_2021" target="_blank">Key opinion leaders: Who are they and why do they matter?</a></p><h1><a name="3"></a>3.

Data-driven marketing</h1><p>The role of analytics and data will increase in marketing. Customer journeys are becoming more complex and this means more touchpoints to use to analyze buying behavior.

The expectations for companies to handle data in a secure way are rising.</p><p>This requires marketers to balance with utilizing data for personalization marketing and respecting the privacy legislation. 57% of US marketers say privacy regulations have increased transparency around data use.</p><p class="small"><img alt="" height="845" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/10-marketing-trends-2021/cache/data-security-emarketer-700x845.png" width="700" /><br /><em>Source: <a href="https://on.emarketer.com/rs/867-SLG-901/images/eMarketer_%20Identity_2020_%20Report_November%202020%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">eMarketer</a></em></p><h1><a name="7"></a>7.

		<title>10 Tips for Creating a Content Calendar</title>
		<link>https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/10-tips-for-creating-a-content-calendar.html</link>
		<description>As the year is soon coming to an end, it’s a good idea to take a moment to plan your content for the next year. Plan and organize your upcoming content effectively by using a Content Calendar. These useful tips will help you get started.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can I continuously create and provide interesting, engaging and relevant content to my potential and current customers? This question often troubles marketing and communications professionals.</p><p>Even when the company&rsquo;s personnel includes talented writers and tech-savvy social media experts, constantly creating new relevant content may feel like a challenging task from time to time. A content calendar may be the solution you are looking for.</p><p>Businesses tend to be motivated to create and share more content, but the scarcity of time and human resources often gets in the way. Especially the companies who handle their digital marketing and content creation in-house can often struggle with carrying out all of their planned content.</p><p>However, the root of the issue is not always the amount of resources itself, but instead the inefficient use of those resources due to poor planning.</p><p>A content calendar is an easy way to combat this issue and to make the most of your company&rsquo;s scarce resources. It is an effective tool for coordinating content creation and helps divide your team&rsquo;s upcoming workload into clear, easily-manageable units.&nbsp;</p><p>By implementing this tool to your planning process, you will have to spend less time on wondering what to write, and instead focus on the creation itself. We gathered 10 tips to help you get you started in creating your own content calendar:</p><h2>1. Define your goals</h2><p>When planning your future content, start with the question: what is the main goal of it? The answer to the question should be used as the basis for determining the right channel and format. Is the content meant to produce new leads, <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/website-traffic-6-tips-on-how-to-drive-people-to-your-site.html" target="_blank">direct readers to a website</a>, gain visibility or possibly grow the number of your Facebook followers?</p><p>The set goals have a substantial effect on to whom, where and how often you publish content. It is therefore important that your team has a clear understanding of your goals prior to and during the planning process.</p><p>Defining your goals should therefore be the first step to implementing a content calendar. Pushing out content without a clear purpose will not benefit your company &ndash; it will only waste resources. The person working on each project or item on the calendar should have a clear idea of what the expected results are.</p><h2>2. Create a template for the calendar</h2><p>There is an abundance of tools that offer calendar features on the web &ndash; feel free to choose whichever template suits you best. However, as adopting a new software can be time-consuming, your content calendar can be as simple as a basic spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p><p>The calendar should have a share option if you&#39;re planning content together with the whole organization. For example, you can create a calendar template with the free Google Sheets tool, which allows anyone participating in content creation to edit the sheet on their own computer to add comments and ideas.</p><p>Your content calendar can be constructed according to your team&rsquo;s specific needs, but it should include at least the following information:</p><ul><li>The channel in which the content will be published</li><li>The topic</li><li>The type of content</li><li>The date and time for publishing</li><li>The person in charge</li><li>Follow-through: has the content been published according to schedule?</li></ul><p>Here is an example of what a simple content calendar template can look like:</p><p><img alt="" height="594" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/10-tips-for-creating-a-content-calendar/cache/content-calendar-example-1000x594.png" width="1000" /></p><h2>3. Choose your channels</h2><p>Find out which channels your current and potential customers use. This will help you define the kind of content you should be focusing on creating. Should you publish articles on your blog? Pictures on Instagram and Twitter? Videos on YouTube? A survey on Facebook?</p><p>It can be beneficial to publish content on various different platforms and in multiple formats, as this will broaden your audience. However, make sure you have enough resources to focus on the platforms you choose to appear on. Prioritize your most important channels and focus on creating high quality content instead of aimlessly posting on all of the platforms you can think of.</p><p>Social media posts tend to be the easiest and least time-consuming type of content to create. However, make sure that your content calendar is not just a social media calendar, but that it includes other more in-depth content as well.</p><p>Press releases, expert articles and guest blogs should be included in your communications and marketing plan for the year, as they are likely to bring more value to your potential customers by providing more information.</p><p>In addition, social media can be used as an effective way to cross-promote and share your more in-depth content. Posting an infographic from a blog post on your Instagram, or sharing an article on LinkedIn or Twitter will create more traffic and bring customers to your website.</p><h2>4. Start with the calendar year</h2><p>Use the calendar year as a base when you start to plan your content. Mark down all important events that you want to build your content around &ndash; holidays, trade fairs, seminars and trainings. This easy step will help you determine the kind of seasonal content you will need in the future, and help you estimate the upcoming workload, which allows your team to prepare for it in advance.</p><h2>5. Add your own content</h2><p>Once you have written down all of the important dates, start to fill in the blanks with relevant content ideas. This content can include:</p><ul><li>Theme posts &ndash; Are you participating in a trade fair or a seminar? Is something related to your operations the current topic of discussion? Follow the general conversation in your field and grab the current topics fast.&nbsp;</li><li>Serial posts &ndash; Are you specialized in a service that you would like to tell more about to your customers? Serial posts are a great way to educate and bring forth your expertise.&nbsp;</li><li>Expert articles and guest blogs regarding your services and current topics in your field</li><li><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/pr-media/overview.html" target="_blank">Press releases</a> about the launch of a new product, research results or your company going international, to name a few</li><li>Seasonal or <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/5-digital-tips-for-the-christmas-season.html" target="_blank">holiday greetings</a></li><li>Videos or pictures from events, campaigns, products and projects</li><li><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/customer-stories.html" target="_blank">Stakeholder stories</a> and interviews in the form of a video or a case example</li><li>Interesting and funny details about the organization &ndash; Who visits the office, and what goes on during a coffee break?</li></ul><p>Make sure that you have enough relevant ideas to fill your schedule. Add variety to your content to keep it interesting.</p><h2>6. Keep evergreen content at hand</h2><p>Content that is not tied to a certain date or time will always remain useful to both your customers and your company. As contemporary themes remain relevant and are constantly searched online, this kind of content is likely to keep getting clicks and visits even after the initial buzz after publishing.</p><p>It is also easy to reintroduce your older timeless articles and blog posts to your audience by adding links to them to your newer content related to similar themes.</p><p>Timeless content can also save you at times when there are delays in your schedule. As it can be created and published at any time, it is good to have ready-made content stored somewhere to be used at times when your team may have to prioritize other tasks. There should be a place in your calendar for timeless content ideas that can be used anytime.</p><h2>7. Make use of prior content</h2><p>You don&#39;t always have to create content from scratch. Most companies have useful content in store that hasn&#39;t been utilized, such as data from the CRM system and customer survey results.</p><p>Old blog posts can also be reused and updated through different channels, such as turning them into short videos. Your potential customers may look for information on various different platforms, which is why it can be a good idea to present similar ideas in different formats. This way you will make the most of all of the valuable content you have created by reaching different target groups.</p><p>Here is an example of a video created based on an article from 2019 <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/blog-seo-17-tips-to-make-your-blog-rank-higher-on-google-with-real-examples.html" target="_blank">Blog SEO: 17 Tips to Make Your Blog Rank Higher on Google (With Real Examples)</a>.</p><div class="embeddedContent oembed-provider-youtube" data-align="none" data-oembed="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOayYfB_ulQ" data-oembed_provider="youtube" data-resizetype="noresize"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" frameborder="0" height="349" scrolling="no" src="https://www.lianatech.com//www.youtube.com/embed/aOayYfB_ulQ?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=Vkm28" width="425"></iframe></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to make sure that the content on your website is up to date, as many potential customers may browse through your older blog posts or articles. Reviewing and updating them occasionally to ensure that your content is accurate will make you look professional and reliable.</p><p>Mark the updated articles to let your readers know that your content is up-to-date, and you continuously want to make it more valuable for them.</p><p><img alt="" height="215" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/10-tips-for-creating-a-content-calendar/updated600.png" width="600" /></p><h2>8. Decide on the publishing frequency and set time limits</h2><p>Think about how often you can realistically publish new content. As creating content is time-consuming it is important to choose a publishing frequency that works for you. Understanding your own boundaries is crucial to the efficiency of the calendar. If it is too full, the content will suffer. However, there should be enough content to create traffic on your website and bring value to your customers on a regular basis.</p><p>A content calendar will help you spot the busiest times for your company. Planning ahead will help both individuals and the whole team prepare for the company&rsquo;s busiest months by ensuring that projects are started and finished well before the publishing date. In other words, the planning should always be time-constrained to make sure that the deadlines are met.</p><p>However, your content calendar should not be set to stone &ndash; a certain degree of flexibility should be considered and allowed in the scheduling. There might be occasions when your company must be able to quickly respond to external events or news in your field. Therefore, sometimes it might be a good idea to move the originally planned and less urgent content for later, and react to the fresh news instead.</p><h2>9. Update and review your plan</h2><p>There is no definitive answer to how long in advance your content should be planned. Planning ahead depends on multiple factors, such as how volatile your field of business is, and perhaps some factors related to your company specifically.</p><p>You should keep in mind, however, that the further ahead you plan your content, the better the flow of content stays uninterrupted. A simple guideline is to plan the main content for the whole year, and then plan weekly and daily content in more detail for the following month.&nbsp;</p><p>There should be a possibility for individuals to share their thoughts and update their plans when needed. It might be a good idea to review the content calendar on a regular basis with the whole team. This will help you to stay on track, and to adapt to possible changes.</p><h2>10. Monitor how your content is received</h2><p>One of the great aspects of digital marketing is that almost everything is measurable. However, after a company spends a significant amount of time on creating and sharing high quality content, measuring the actual effects of the content is often left in the background.</p><p>You should devote some time to examining your own operations and data, and consider them in your future plans. Which posts on social media have sparked up the most conversation? Which blog posts have been shared? How much visibility have your <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/pr-media/overview.html" target="_blank">press releases</a> gotten in the media?</p><p>Once you know what kind of content interests your readers, you can evolve and create even more interesting and engaging content in the future.</p><p>Read <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/guide-to-measuring-the-results-of-external-communications.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=10-tips-for-creating-a-content-calendar" target="_blank">our guide on measuring the results of your external communications</a> to learn more about the performance of your content.</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/guide-to-measuring-the-results-of-external-communications.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=10-tips-for-creating-a-content-calendar" target="_blank"><span class="btn btn-primary">Download the guide</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Marketing Automation &amp; CRM – the Greatest Benefits and Best Practices</title>
		<link>https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/marketing-automation-crm-the-greatest-benefits-and-best-practices.html</link>
		<description>The combination of marketing automation and customer relationship management (CRM) brings many benefits to marketing and sales teams and the entire company. Jump in to learn more about these advantages and how to utilize the solutions together efficiently.</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketing automation is an effective solution for sending highly targeted messages and pushing deals forward in the sales pipeline. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a tool for gathering and organizing all your customer data. But what happens when these two solutions are combined and their features are utilized together?</p><p>Dive in to learn what are the best ways to utilize the combination of marketing automation and CRM and what value this duet can actually bring to you and your business. We also show five practical use-case examples you can use for inspiration. At&nbsp;the end of this article, you can book yourself a free trial of the comprehensive CRM solution Pipedrive.&nbsp;</p><h1>The tools in a nutshell</h1><p>The integration of marketing automation and CRM has many perks. It helps to deepen the cooperation of marketing and sales, enables a better understanding of customer behavior, improves the lead quality and saves resources.</p><p>To understand how this is possible, some basic knowledge of both systems is needed. Here it comes in a nutshell:</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/marketing-automation/overview.html" target="_blank">Marketing automation</a> is software designed to automate some repetitive marketing tasks, like emails or push notifications. With automation technology, you can pull data from other channels and utilize it in marketing campaigns.</p><p>Marketing automation enables carefully targeted, personalized and rightly-timed customer communication. Automation technology can be used for many purposes &ndash; one is to drive leads through the sales funnel into conversion.</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/marketing-automation-survey-results-2.0.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=automation_plus_CRM"><img alt="Liana Technologies' survey respondents rated improved targeting of messages and a better marketing ROI as the most prominent benefits of marketing automation." height="1000" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/marketing-automation-survey-results-2020/cache/benefits-700x1000.png" width="700" /></a></p><p>In our <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/marketing-automation-survey-results-2.0.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=automation_plus_CRM" target="_blank">international marketing automation survey</a>, the respondents rated improved targeting of messages and a better <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/know-the-value-of-your-marketing-actions-the-basics-of-roi.html" target="_blank">marketing ROI</a> as the most prominent benefits of marketing automation.</p><p>A customer relationship management (CRM) solution allows you to manage all your company&#39;s relationships and interactions with customers and prospects. It stores, for instance, the information on how long a person has been a customer and the history of their purchases.</p><p>CRM helps to segment customers accurately, plan sales activities, improve customer service, monitor deals and streamline processes.</p><p>All customer data exists in CRM, which makes integrating it with marketing automation necessary in order to get data into the automation system. However, CRM and marketing automation benefit each other much more than just by being a source for customer contacts.</p><p><img alt="Meme picture: a man is pouring fuel on fire, symbolizing that data is fuel for marketing automation." height="502" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/marketing-automation-and-crm/cache/automation-data-meme-500x502,e=jpeg.jpg" width="500" /></p><p class="small"><em>CRM and marketing automation greatly benefit each other by passing on useful information between the solutions.</em></p><h1>The benefits of integrating marketing automation and CRM</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s go through the greatest advantages the combination of marketing automation and CRM brings to you.</p><h2>Improved cooperation between marketing and sales</h2><p>The challenges in cooperation between sales and marketing is an evergreen topic. This is where the integration of CRM and marketing automation steps in.</p><p>The buyer journey doesn&rsquo;t look the same for every prospect &ndash; the route is rarely straightforward and might even seem illogical compared to the path you had in mind. This means that sales and marketing must work closely together in order to meet the prospect&#39;s needs and help them to convert at any possible point on the customer path.</p><p>Sales and marketing often have different views of what can be defined as a lead. Integrating CRM and marketing automation makes the touchpoints more clear. Sales will have a better vision of when they should contact the prospect, and marketing gets to know in which stages their messages are needed.</p><h2>Two-way flow of customer data</h2><p>Using marketing automation and CRM together enables a two-way flow of customer data. This is great news, because&nbsp;</p><ul><li>No data gets lost in the way, because it&rsquo;s imported and exported from one system to another</li><li>You can trust that there are no blockages in the flow of data&nbsp;</li><li>You don&rsquo;t have to track communication with one customer from several places.</li></ul><p>You&rsquo;ll be able to send automated messages to different segment groups fetched from CRM. After implementing the marketing actions, the data in CRM is enriched with the customer&#39;s actions. (Psst, you&rsquo;ll get more tips for this later in this article!)</p><h2>Personalized customer communication</h2><p>Personalizing messages is crucial: the more personalized the messages are, the more likely the customer responds to them. However, <a href="https://www.evergage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Evergage-2018-Trends-in-Personalization-Survey.pdf" target="_blank">55% of marketers</a> don&rsquo;t feel they have sufficient data and insights for effective personalization. At the same time, customer data is stored in several different systems.</p><p>The combination of CRM and marketing automation offers a solution to the problem: you can send triggered, tailored and personalized messages based on customer&rsquo;s behavior. Certain customer data points can be used to personalize your messages: past purchases, won and lost deals, interests, company data and so on.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Find new ideas for personalizing your email messages: <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/8-tips-to-personalize-your-emails.html" target="_blank">8 Tips to Personalize Your Emails</a></div><p>The more systems are attached to automation, the clearer the picture of customer&rsquo;s behavior is. You can gather together all possible actions, like newsletter clicks and website visits into the customer&#39;s CRM profile.</p><p>As an end result, sales can be more strategic in their communications and the interaction with the customer is more efficient. Marketing gets a better vision of what kind of messages resonate the best and which content leads find the most helpful.</p><h2>Seamless customer experience &ndash; and more sales 💰</h2><p>Thanks to synchronization of marketing automation and CRM, you&rsquo;ll be able to serve your current and future customers better. You can more easily examine and analyze customers&rsquo; behavior and base your future actions on those insights.</p><p>Thus, you can send marketing messages your customers are interested in at the right time, leading to more up- and cross-sales and higher customer satisfaction. The sales process might also shorten because customers&rsquo; and prospects&rsquo; needs are always responded to at the right time.</p><p>A modern automation platform also enables giving points to prospect&rsquo;s actions. After a certain amount of points is reached, sales know that the lead is warm enough to be contacted. In the best-case scenario, before making any calls or sending any emails, sales has a large amount of data in CRM about the prospect&#39;s actions and needs.&nbsp;</p><h1>How to get started</h1><p>Now we understand why it is so important to use these tools together, but the question still is how to do it. Here are the steps to follow.</p><ul><li><strong>Acquire the technology.</strong> Invest in high-quality solutions that are already integrated together. For example, <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/marketing-automation/overview.html" target="_blank">LianaAutomation</a> is integrated with popular CRM platform <a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/" target="_blank">Pipedrive</a>, so you can start working effectively right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Plan the process</strong>. Gather sales and marketing together to visualize and jot down the whole buying journey and to see which actions are needed during the way. Include pre-sales marketing, sales contact points and new customer onboarding to the roadmap.</li><li><strong>Plan the personalization</strong>. Decide which data points you will use to personalize the customer journey. There&#39;s plenty to choose from, from location to age distribution, from types of products purchased to the number of purchases. Make sure that you collect all the needed information by using subscription forms, for example.</li><li><strong>Create automation workflows</strong>. Start building the automation workflows for different purposes, like warming up the lead, onboarding and re-heating the customer relationship. Find inspiration from our free <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/7-inspiring-marketing-automation-examples-to-help-your-business-grow.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=automation" target="_blank">handbook of marketing automation examples to help your business grow</a>.</li><li><strong>Analyze and fine-tune</strong>. Once you&rsquo;ve created and launched the automation, you need to monitor the results and make some adjustments if there&rsquo;s room for improvement. You can try how fine-tuning the headlines, content or timing of the automation letters affects the results.</li></ul><h1>Practical use-case examples</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s go through some examples of using marketing automation and CRM together, and boosting sales at the same time.</p><h2>Onboarding</h2><p><strong>Data source:</strong> CRM<br /><strong>Channel:</strong> Email / push notification&nbsp;<br /><strong>Trigger:</strong> New signup / first purchase</p><p>Onboarding is one of the most popular ways to use marketing automation, and CRM adds a lot of power to the process.</p><p>After the sales mark a deal won in CRM, it gives a trigger to marketing automation to start the onboarding process for the new customer. Educate and give information to the customers and help them to use your products.</p><p>Later in the onboarding messages you can start to drive extra sales. One smart way to do this is to run a referral campaign, like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> did. By offering free data storage for people who invited their friends to use the platform, Dropbox managed to reach <a href="https://viral-loops.com/blog/dropbox-grew-3900-simple-referral-program/" target="_blank">3 900% growth in just 15 months</a>.</p><p><img alt="By offering free data storage for people who invited their friends to use the platform, Dropbox managed to reach 3 900% growth in just 15 months." class="shadow-image" height="342" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/marketing-automation-and-crm/cache/dropbox-referral-campaign-700x342.jpg" width="700" /></p><p class="small"><em>Dropbox managed to reach&nbsp;significant growth by running a referral campaign as a part of their onboarding automation.</em></p><h2>Upsell</h2><p><strong>Data source:</strong> CRM<br /><strong>Channel:</strong> Email<br /><strong>Trigger:</strong> Customer segment: loyal clients</p><p>The customers who do multiple purchases are interested in your company and are often ready to buy some more. This makes them a great segment group for your upselling campaign. You can easily pull out the needed data from CRM, for example those customers who have bought at least three times from you.</p><p>Send a personalized campaign letter with a tempting discount code. Set an expiry date to make sure the customers react fast, and show clearly what value the offer brings to the receiver and why they need to seize the offer.</p><p>After a couple of days, you can send a reminder for those customers who didn&rsquo;t purchase from the first email, telling that the campaign ends in three days.</p><p>At the same time, the upsell campaign offers a chance for more detailed segmenting. You can segment your loyal customers to platinum level, and decrease their status if they don&rsquo;t purchase from the campaign.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Read <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/customer-stories/tempur.html" target="_blank">Tempur&rsquo;s customer story</a> to learn how they utilized customer data for successful cross- and upselling campaigns.</div><h2>Birthday gifts</h2><p><strong>Data source:</strong> CRM<br /><strong>Channel:</strong> Email/SMS<br /><strong>Trigger:</strong> Customer&rsquo;s birthday</p><p>Remember your customer with a nice gesture on their special day! In B2C marketing you can celebrate the customer&rsquo;s birthday, in B2B the anniversary of the first purchase.</p><p>Set the automation to check daily from CRM the people who have their birthday coming in ten days. Send these customers a personalized letter to celebrate the coming occasion.</p><p>It&rsquo;s good to be proactive when it comes to anniversary messages since many of us like to plan the celebration beforehand. When the benefits are known well in advance, the customer is more likely to seize your offer.</p><h2>Waking up inactive clients</h2><p><strong>Data source: </strong>CRM<br /><strong>Channel:</strong> email / SMS<br /><strong>Trigger: </strong>Condition</p><p>Passive customers are a great segment to encourage to make business with you again. Use CRM to fetch a segment of customers who haven&rsquo;t purchased in a certain period of time. Start targeting them with personalized messages to warm them up again and encourage them to come back to you.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to communicate the value also in these messages. Show how coming back to you benefits the customer. For instance, you can send the customer an SMS telling &ldquo;we have a free delivery for you&rdquo;.</p><p>This automation chain closely resembles the upsell automation but has a different target group. The automation can run in the background and be repeated monthly or whichever cycle is suitable for your business.</p><p><img alt="Google is activating passive Google Maps users with an email that encourages them to add a new photo or a review." height="808" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/blog/marketing-automation-and-crm/cache/we-miss-you-on-google-maps-500x808.png" width="500" /></p><p class="small"><em><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> is activating passive Google Maps users by encouraging them to add a new photo or a review.</em></p><h2>Pull the data back to CRM</h2><p>It&rsquo;s important that marketing automation and CRM work in a two-way manner. You have to make sure that instead of just delivering the data, you also pull the data back to the CRM from the automation platform.</p><p>A handy way to secure this is to give the contacts scores based on how they react to your marketing messages. You can give the contacts different points on different phases in the automation chain: one point for opening the message, five points for clicking the salesy CTA and so on.</p><p>Thanks to the scoring system, you can separate hot leads from colder ones. Use CRM filtering to fetch all of the contacts that have lead scores over 5 and hand them over to your sales every morning.</p><h1>Try the CRM that Boosts Closing Rates by an Average of 28%</h1><p>An effective automated chain of messages can be created only with rich customer data at hand. A reliable CRM system is, therefore, a must. Pipedrive users close an average of 28% more deals after their first year of using the CRM. Get more clients with the help of Pipedrive and drive upsells with targeted marketing automation campaigns.</p><p>Contact us to learn more about our integrated package of Pipedrive and LianaAutomation.</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/pipedrive-partnership.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=automation_plus_CRM" target="_blank"><span class="btn btn-primary">Try Pipedrive for free</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Know the Value of Your Marketing Actions - the Basics of ROI</title>
		<link>https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/know-the-value-of-your-marketing-actions-the-basics-of-roi.html</link>
		<description>With ROI, you’re able to have a better understanding of how your marketing actions perform. But what is it exactly, and why it is important to calculate it?</description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no secret that keeping track of your marketing actions is something that you have to do: you need to know the value of your actions in order to be efficient and react quickly. This is when ROI, which is short for Return on Investment, enters the scene: with ROI, you&rsquo;re able to have a better understanding of how your actions perform, and what changes need to be done.</p><p>ROI sounds like something that you want to master but you&rsquo;re not sure how and where to start? No worries, in this article, we will tell you exactly what ROI is, how to calculate it, and why it is important to calculate it.</p><h2>ROI measures the value of your investments</h2><p>In one sentence, ROI means the amount of money that a company receives in return for the investments they make. Therefore, when applied to the investments made for your marketing actions, ROI tells you the profit you get from those actions. In its simplest form, the formula for calculating your ROI looks like this:</p><p><img alt="Image: How to calculate ROI" height="297" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/know-the-value-of-your-roi-2020/cache/calculation-roi-2020-650x297.png" width="650" /></p><p>If an advertisement campaign has cost $3,000 in total and it has produced $15,000 in additional sales, its ROI would be (15000 &minus; 3000) &divide; 3000 &times; 100 = 400%.</p><p>ROI is an indicator that enables you to determine the value of your short-term campaigns since you can compare your results to the previous numbers. However, you can also assess the efficiency of your marketing actions in the long run: it can help you find the most efficient marketing channels for your organization, for instance.</p><p>One important thing is left to say: you need to keep in mind that ROI is not static, so it&rsquo;s best to calculate it regularly and make changes whenever necessary if you want to use it to its full potential.</p><h2>What is a good ROI?</h2><p>The ultimate goal of a company is usually to make profit. Hence, when it comes to marketing, you can aim for a&nbsp;ROI of a 5:1 ratio (that&rsquo;s approximately 500%). It is a quite high ratio since anything below a ratio of 2:1 would be considered as non-profitable, as you need to cover the cost of production together with the cost of marketing.</p><p>Among all the biggest marketing approaches, you can seek a bigger ROI when it comes to email marketing since it&rsquo;s possible to reach a ROI of 675%, according to <a href="https://profitworks.ca/blog/455-marketing-return-on-investment-what-is-a-benchmark-average-and-what-marketing-methods-have-the-best-roi" target="_blank">Profitworks</a>.</p><h2>What is included in marketing costs?</h2><p>When counting the profit margin of marketing actions, the costs usually contain:</p><ul><li>Social media advertising and Google ads</li><li>Trade fairs and events</li><li>Marketing tools, like a newsletter tool and automation tool</li><li>Physical marketing material, like flyers, posters, and pins</li><li>Traditional media, like radio, newspaper, and roadside ads</li><li>Marketing and communications agencies and consultation costs</li></ul><p>It is important that you take into account all of your marketing channels when calculating ROI, or you might miss out on meaningful data that could help improve your marketing strategies otherwise.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">Looking for low-cost marketing ideas? Check our <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/resources/blog/5-low-cost-marketing-ideas-infographic.html" target="_blank">5 tips and our infographic</a>.</div><h2>Analytics as the basis</h2><p>To properly calculate your marketing ROI, you need a clear picture of the profits and investments of your company. Some tools like <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> help you have an overview of your sales revenue and other goals, that you can then compare to your investments. You can import data from different channels, for example, your billing system, CRM, or online store, to your marketing automation tool to see the bigger picture.</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/marketing-automation/overview.html" target="_blank">A comprehensive automation tool</a> combines data from different channels and tells you if an unidentified website visitor has finally turned into a buying customer, and where they came from. This means that you can compare your investments and profits of different marketing channels to find the most efficient channels.</p><p class="small"><img alt="Set your goals with Google Analytics" height="378" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/roi_google_analytics-goals.png" width="750" /><br />Image: You can see your sales revenue straight from Google Analytics.</p><p>There are also separate ROI tools on the market that can be integrated with marketing and analytics tools and count your profit margin for you. For example, <a href="https://funnel.io/" target="_blank">Funnel</a> calculates your ROI according to your data, also taking different currencies and currency changes into consideration.</p><div class="alert border border-200 bg-100">The results of external communications can and should also be measured. <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/guide-to-measuring-the-results-of-external-communications.html?utm_source=blog_article&amp;utm_medium=know_the_value_of_your_actions_roi" target="_blank">Download our free guide to learn the process</a>.</div><h2>Go backwards</h2><p>Setting key metrics will make it easier to calculate the efficiency of your different marketing channels. Those metrics will differ depending on what you want to achieve with your marketing. For example, the marketing team of a consumer-oriented company will try to increase the number of buying customers, while for a sales-oriented company, the goal of marketing will be to produce valuable leads to the sales team.</p><p>In order to determine the right key metrics that will ultimately help you calculate your ROI, you can follow the customer&rsquo;s journey: the different steps will make it easier for you to choose the metrics that apply to your company, and your marketing strategy. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>What is the average profit of one lead?&nbsp;</li><li>At what point does a newsletter subscriber or a person who clicks on a LinkedIn ad become a lead that is directed to the sales team?&nbsp;</li><li>How does a potential customer at the very beginning of the buyer&#39;s journey become interested enough to subscribe to the newsletter or click on a display ad?</li></ul><p class="small"><img alt="Image: buyer's journey" height="346" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/know-the-value-of-your-roi-2020/cache/customer-journey-en-d-800x346.png" width="800" /><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/front-page.html#touchpoints" target="_blank"> </a><br />Image: Different technologies are utilized at different stages of the buyer&#39;s journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Determining the ROI of your channels from the outset is challenging but necessary. A tip to make it easier: you need to go backwards on the buyer&#39;s path and see what percentage has advanced from one stage to the next.&nbsp;These steps will give you a clear picture of how efficiently your investments in, for example, Facebook content marketing are being returned to you.</p><h2>Limits of ROI</h2><p>ROI is therefore a tool that will enable you to have a better view of how your marketing actions are performing and to also have more concrete results to show. But just like with other tools, ROI has its limits that you might want to keep in mind.</p><p>Indeed, ROI only takes into consideration the financial side of your investment. However, marketing is also about brand awareness and building customer loyalty, for example, and those do not immediately generate profit.</p><p>Also, what about the future? ROI, unfortunately, cannot predict if your actions will keep on performing well later, but keeping a close eye on analytics and utilizing different scenario tools can help you find out which channels are most likely to produce the most revenue in the future.</p><h2>Grow ROI with marketing automation</h2><p>How to use marketing automation for increasing your ROI? <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/7-inspiring-marketing-automation-examples-to-help-your-business-grow.html?utm_source=blog_article&amp;utm_medium=know_the_value_of_your_actions_roi" target="_blank">Read our guide on marketing automation</a> and discover seven marketing automation examples to inspire your next campaign!</p><p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/7-inspiring-marketing-automation-examples-to-help-your-business-grow.html?utm_source=blog_article&amp;utm_medium=know_the_value_of_your_actions_roi" target="_blank"><img alt="Button to download Marketing Automation guide" height="365" kv_aslink="0" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/guides-whitepapers-landing-page/cache/marketing-automation-handbook-650x365.png" width="650" /> </a></p>]]></content:encoded>
